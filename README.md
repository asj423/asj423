## Extra-curricular projects
 - **Real-time Facial recognition software with registration database** _(Python, SQL, OpenCV)_
   - Designed and implemented a **real-time** facial recognition system integrated with a school registration database to automate attendance tracking.
   - Developed the facial recognition module using **Python and the OpenCV library**, enabling accurate and efficient student identification.
   - Built and managed a **relational database using SQL** to store and update attendance records dynamically based on facial detection results.
   - Ensured seamless interaction between the front-end recognition system and back-end database, optimizing performance and reliability for **real-world use**.
 - **Posture Detection and Correction Bot** _(Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, C++, arduino)_
    - Collaborated in a team to develop a standalone posture correction bot that monitored body alignment using computer vision.
    - Programmed the detection system in **Python** to track joint positions and calculate angles to assess posture, distinguishing between upright and slouched positions.
    - Deployed the system on an arduino, ensuring all code and processing could run independently **without external hardware**.
    - Focused on **real-time analysis and feedback**, enhancing the botâ€™s potential use in health, fitness, and ergonomic applications.
